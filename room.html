                    <h2>Project Outline</h2>
                    <p>In my studies I was tasked with making mutliple assets each week, my last task was
                        to put these assets together to make an environmental scene. The two assets I chose 
                        were my toy train and cat robot.

                    <h2>My Process</h2>

                    <p>
                        While brainstorming ideas for environment's, I found various images of isometric rooms,
                        as this was one of my bigger projects, I wanted to create something visually pleasing, but 
                        simple so I could finish it before the deadline. I beleived a isometric room would be a great way
                        to execute a simple scene, that can still be detailed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also settled on the idea for a toymakers studio, because I modeled these two assets after
                        children's toys. I thought having a toy story inspired scene would also bring more character to a simple environment,
                        and aligned with the theme.
