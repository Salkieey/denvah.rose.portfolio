                    <h1> Project Outline </h1>
                    <p> My Oracle deck, Set in Stone, was designed to capture how the meaning of monuments can be altered depending on both it's context and the person perceiving them.
                        I was inspired by one of my lectures, I found it fascinating how simple statues or landmarks could hold so much symbolism in them. Since this was for an assignment,
                        I have only created three cards so far, but I hope to add to my deck in the future. 
                    </p>

                    <h1>The Monuments</h1>
                    <p> The assignment outline gave us a huge amount of freedom, so I decided to restict myself to monuments that had folklore or stories behind their creation. </p>

                            <h2> Medusa</h2>
                            <h3> The Myth</h3>
                            <p>Medusa, one of the most widely known myths of ancient Greece, was once a mortal woman known for her 
                            beauty before she was turned into a monster by the
                            god Athena, whether this curse was to protect or punish medusa is up to personal interpretation</p>
                            <p> Medusa seemed like the obvious choice, her story in particular, atleast in my experience, has been altered time and time again because of the context
                                and the audience consuming it. There are a number of monuments that represent Medusa however I decided on one by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680).

                            <h3> The Myth </h3>
                            <p>The Trung sisters were two Vietnamese warriors of the 1st century who started a rebellion against the Chinese invaders </p>
                            <p>Local myth reports, to avoid capture, the two sisters threw themselves into a river and turned to stone</p>
                            <p>The Trung Sister's are a lesser known myth, however while doing research on different monuments I couldn't help but be drawn to
                                thier story. 
                            </p>

                                <h2> Niobe</h2>
                                <h3>The Myth</h3>
                                <p>Ancient greek mythology tells a tale of Niobe, a mortal Queen who insulted the God Leto, by bragging about how many children she had in comparison. 
                                Leto's children Artemis and Apollo retaliated by slaughtering all but one of Niobe's children. 
                                A more merciful god turned Niobe to stone after seeing how distraught she was</p>
                                <p>Unlike the other myths that inspired their monuments, Niobe's monument was a completly natural occurence, and can still be found today.
                                I chose this image in particular, because of the contrast in composition in juxtaposition to the myth surrounding it, 
                                I thought it was really poetic to frame such a tragic tale in a beautiful and bright image.
                                </p>

                <h1>Final Products</h1>
                <p>I created the final products based off of their monuments as well as my interpretation of their stories.</p>
                    <div id="three-cards">

                        <div class="cards">
                            <img src="images/Medusa.png" alt="My final image of Medusa" width="305px" height="458px">
                            <p>I based Medusa's demeanor and expression off of her monument, she's distressed at her situation and even attempts to "sheild" a petrified warrior from her
                                predicament. Personally, I grew up with the interpretation of Medusa being a victim of her "blessing", so I decided to reflect that in the colour pallete,
                                Medusa is pure, symbolized by the bright teals yet her situation is far from pure, it is something she is constantly surrounded by, a fate she has ultimately accepted,
                                portrayed by her sitting atop her the petrified bodies of fallen warriors sent to slay her.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                            

                        <div class="cards">
                            <img src="images/Persevearance.png" alt="My final image of The Trung Sisters" width="305px" height="458px">
                            <p>The Trung Sister's Pose is also based off of their monument, however I ended up having them hold hands to portray their strong bond. Their story is still celebrated today
                                moreover, many people claim that Vietnam, would not exist without their rebellion. I ended up using more saturated and lighter colours because of this, despite their more thrilling and ultimately
                                tragic story, I wanted to depict how their tale is seen as awe inspiring, and a herioc feat.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="cards">
                            <img src="images/Consequences.png" alt="My final image of Niobe" width="304px" height="455px">
                            <p>You might have noticed by now that all of their poses or experssions are inspired by their monument counterparts, Niobe is no different,
                            however I interpreted the grassy hill as a cloak she is clutching around herself, to shelter her from the horrific consequences of her actions.
                            I used cool and warm tones to draw the eye to Niobe, framing her in a pink sunset, moreover I wanted to also capture that juxtaposition between the beautiful scenery
                            and tragic tale so it all came together nicely.
