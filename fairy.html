                    <h2>Project Outline</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was tasked with creating a kid's game concept, so I decided to take inspiration from my own
                        favourite childhood games. I used to really enjoy those scientific apps, where you assist local scientists 
                        by taking picture of local fauna and flora, however I remember that the UI was fairly boring, atleast for the one I used 
                        and outside of a point system there was a lack of motivation, particularly for children. Another app that I enjoyed was 
                        Pokemon Go, I think it excelled in the aspects I previously mentioned, capturing little Pokemon while walking around
                        was one of my favourite things to do, I also belive that discovering and trading new Pokemon encouraged children 
                        to excersice more. I wanted to combine these two game's to create a new concept that children of Australia can enjoy.

                    <h2>My Process</h2>
                    <h3>The Sketching Phase</h3>
                    <p> My intent was for users to take pictures of local flora, and after a certain goal was reached, such as taking pictures of the same plant in different places 
                        five different times, they could discover the fairy inspired by that plant. Now that I had a clear vision, I moved on to brainstorming ideas, 
                        I decided to focus on the natural flora of Australia.  To design these I was heavily inspired by Pokemon's creature designs and wanted to create similar concepts.
                        So I chose a few native plants and started
                        sketching out my ideas.                                 
                    </p>

                <article>
                    <h3>Finalising Ideas</h3>
                    <p>I chose only a few concepts to finalise, and then I went on to fully line and colour them. I was left with four designs, 
                        my favourite of these was by far the Daisy fae, so I decided to make them the mascot of the game. I thought that the audience
                        would also have an easier time recognising the design, as daisys are one of the most common and iconic wildflowers.    
                    </p>

                <article>
                    <h3>Moving onto the game art</h3>
                    <p> Now that I have created the designs for my characters, I needed to make the UI match their designs.
                        I decided on a more "rustic" approach rather than the futuristic one that Pokemon has gone for, I wanted users to feel like they 
                        were the ones exploring, as if they were documenting these creatures like an older scientist might. So I decided on UI that looked almost 
                        scrap-booked together. I made various sketches on each of these layouts, and finalised them with hand-drawn lineart and a warm colour pallete.                        
                    </p>
                </article>
                <div>
                    <div class="two-img">

                        <img src="images/Fae/fairy-content.png" alt="Final render of a journal for the game">

                    <div class="columns">

                </div>

                <article>
                    <h3>Other Menu's</h3>
                    <p>I also needed to include a way for users to take pictures of plant's, while I did consider using the normal photo app 
                        I thought creating my own UI could be more immersive. I also wanted players to earn points, however I didn't have a reason for them to use them,
                        or a place for them to spend them yet. So I decided to create a shop where players can buy various item's for their littl plant fairies. There also neede to be 
                        a place where they could give their fairies these items, so I created a "room" for users to decorate for their individual plant's.

                        <h3>Additional UI</h3>
                        <p>
                            The final thing I added was a loading screen, I wanted the image to be simple yet align with the game concepts. 
                            I brainstormed various ideas, but ended up settling on the one that featured the dairy fairy.  
                            I made the additional UI/loading bar match the camera. 
                        </p>
